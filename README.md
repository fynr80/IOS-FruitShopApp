# IOS-FruitShopApp
Fruitshop app with swift for iOS.
There are two applications. 
One for the user, where he can buy fruit.
On the other hand, the second app for the customer where he can see the orders.

The Applications won't work because there is no server in this repository.
The server was given by the university, so I have no right to add the server into this repository.
